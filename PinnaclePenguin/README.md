You need to install git to use the github version control from this [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).<br>
You need to install Node.js to use the npm package installer from this [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).<br>
You also need to make a MongoDB account to access the database from this [website](https://www.mongodb.com/).<br>
And to access the pproject's MongoDB api key, just shoot a message to Dan to request it.

## Before you run the project, you need to install some dependencies:<br>

npm install react react-dom

### For the root project directory:
